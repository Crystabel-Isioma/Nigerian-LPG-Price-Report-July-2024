# Nigerian LPG Price Report – July 2024 (5KG Cylinder Analysis)

This project presents a clean, data driven examination of Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) prices across Nigeria’s 36 states plus the Federal Capital Territory (FCT).

The analysis focuses on 5KG cylinder prices, comparing:
- July 2024 vs June 2024 (Month over Month)
- July 2024 vs July 2023 (Year over Year)

The goal is to highlight price increases, reductions, regional shifts, and affordability patterns using a simple but effective Excel workflow and a polished PowerPoint presentation.

## Background & Project Purpose

LPG (cooking gas) is a major household energy source in Nigeria, and price volatility directly affects:

- Household budgets
- Retailer margins
- State level affordability
- National energy trends

This project was created to:

- Measure how 5KG LPG prices changed across Nigeria’s 36 states + FCT
- Compare prices Month over Month (June → July 2024)
- Compare prices Year over Year (July 2023 → July 2024)
- Identify states with the sharpest increases and reductions
- Present the insights in a simple, professional visual report

---

## Dataset Description

The dataset includes price observations for:

- 36 states + FCT 
- 5KG LPG cylinder prices
- Three time periods:
  - June 2024
  - July 2024
  - July 2023

Columns in the dataset:

- State
- Price_5KG_June_2024
- Price_5KG_July_2024
- Price_5KG_July_2023

This structure allowed clean MoM and YoY analysis.

## Methods & Analytical Steps

1. Load dataset in Excel  
   Each row contained a Nigerian state (36 + FCT) with its LPG prices.

2. Compute Month over Month Change  
   Formula used:  
   July 2024 – June 2024  
   This highlighted states where LPG became more expensive or cheaper.

3. Compute Year over Year Change  
   Formula used:  
   July 2024 – July 2023  
   This revealed long term pricing trends affected by inflation and supply dynamics.

5. Conditional Formatting  
   - Red = price increase  
   - Green = price reduction  
   This improved clarity for quick state level comparison.

6. Visual Reporting in PowerPoint  
   A one page, executive style PowerPoint slide was created, summarizing:
   - Most affected states
   - Highest increases
   - Price stability zones
   - MoM vs YoY comparison  
   The slide was exported as a clean PDF for upload.

## Key Insights

1. Month over Month (June → July 2024)  
   Most states recorded price increases, indicating higher mid year LPG costs.

2. Year over Year (July 2023 → July 2024)  
   Many states experienced clear upward inflation, showing long term market pressure.

3. Regional Variation  
   Certain states remained stable or recorded mild reductions, suggesting stronger supply chains or better local market competition.

4. Price Volatility  
   States showing both MoM and YoY increases represent high volatility regions, where consumer affordability is most affected.

---

## Expanded Insight Breakdown

1. Immediate Household Impact  
   Sharp MoM increases directly affect monthly household budgets, especially for lower income regions.

2. Inflationary Trend Signals  
   YoY changes reveal broader economic patterns:
   - Cost of importation
   - Transportation fees
   - Market inflation pressure

3. Supply Chain Stability  
   States with stable or declining prices may have:
   - Better LPG distribution systems
   - More local suppliers
   - More competitive retail pricing

4. Policy Interpretation  
   Consistent YoY increments across many states suggest the need for:
   - Distribution improvements
   - Reduced transport dependency
   - More localized LPG infrastructure

## Why This Project Matters

This project demonstrates:

- Ability to extract insights from simple datasets
- Use of Month over Month and Year over Year analysis
- Clean visual storytelling using PowerPoint
- Real world relevance (pricing, inflation, household impact)
- Competent Excel-based analysis style
- Ability to convert raw data into understandable business insights

Employers value clarity and thinking not tools alone. This project shows both.

---

## Limitations
- Only 5KG cylinder prices analyzed (12KG to be added later).
- Dataset assumes accuracy from reporting sources.
- No advanced modeling (by design).
- No additional economic variables included (exchange rate, logistics cost, etc.).

These are normal and acceptable limitations for a focused Excel project.

---

## Data Quality Notes

Before analysis:
- Verified all 37 regions were present
- Checked numeric formatting
- Removed duplicate records
- Confirmed all month labels were correct
- Ensured no missing price values

Data quality was strong and required no major corrections.

## How to Run This Project

1. Download the Excel files from this repository.
2. Open `GAS_PRICE_WATCH_JULY_2024_WORK.xlsx`.
3. Review the computed columns:
   - Month-over-Month changes
   - Year-over-Year changes
